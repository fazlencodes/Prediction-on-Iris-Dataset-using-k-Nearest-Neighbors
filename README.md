# Prediction-on-Iris-Dataset-using-k-Nearest-Neighbors


I have referred a book, Introduction to Machine Learning with Python A Guide for Data Scientists by Andreas C. Müller, Sarah Guido for this project.

Using, KNN model, to predict a which species do a flower with a new data belongs to. There were three species in this dataset; setosa, versicolor, or virginica. I have split the dataset into two sets, first is train set, for the builing of the model, and second set is test st, which is used to evaluate where the model is preforming correctly or not. Based on this book, by Andreas C. Müller, Sarah Guido, KNN is used, because it enables to predict by using the new dataset by examining the closest neighbor in the train set. The accuracy of the test set was 97%, which shows the model is working correctly.
